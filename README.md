<http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=INTERNETARCHIVE.BAK/git-annex_implementation>

You can use git-annex commands by hand, if you prefer, but the iabak
script automates several things for you.

Clone this git repository to somewhere that has a lot of disk space,
and run the iabak script to get started.

Currently, iabak handles initial download of data, but not long-term
maintenance tasks. You'll want to stop running it once it's downloaded
enough. Just hit ctrl-C at any time.
